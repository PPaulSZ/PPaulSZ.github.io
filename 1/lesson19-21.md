e.g. The physicist rightly dreads precise argument, since an argumet that is convincing only if it is precise loses akk its force if the assumptions on which it is based are alighty changed, [whereas] an argument that is convicing though imprecise may well be stable under small perturbations of its underlying assumptions

翻译：物理学家合理的害怕精确论断，因为如果他所记的前提被稍微改变，那么仅仅在精确时才有说服力的论断将会丧失他所有的力量，但是一个并不精确却具有说服力的论断在其基本假设发生轻微干扰的时候将会依然稳定可靠。

## lesson 20

e.g. The method of scientific investigation is nothing but the expression of the necessary mode of working of the human mind and it is simply the mode by which all phenomena are reasoned about and given precise and exact explanation.

翻译：科学调查的方法不过是人类思维公关做的必要模式的表达，并且它只不过是一种模式，通过这种模式，所有的现象被推理并被给出精确的解释。

e.g. You have all heard it repeated that men of science work by means of induction and deduction and that by the help of these operations, they, in a sort of sense, manage to extract from behind the cover of mysterious Nature certain natual laws that rule the world with certainty.

翻译见以往课程

e.g. Over the years, tools and technology themselves as a source of fundamental immovation have largely been ignored by historians and philosophers of science.

翻译：多年以来，作为基础革命来源的科学技术很大程度上被科学界的历史学家以及哲学家们所忽略，

e.g. How well the predictions will be validated by later performance depends upon the amount, reliability, and appropriateness of the information used and on the skill and wisdom with which it is interpreted.

翻译：预言将会被后来的表现如何证实，依赖于所使用信息的数量，可靠性和恰当性，并且依赖于用来解释他的技术和智慧。

翻译：这个趋势是从二战时期开始的，在哪是很多政府都达成一个结论，即在科学成就上政府所想要做出的具体需求不能被详细地预见到。
